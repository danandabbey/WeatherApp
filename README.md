# otium.dev

At this time this is a simple weather app, I hope to add more functionality
in the future. You can clone this package and follow the steps below to use the 
app.

Steps to Clone and Open

1. clone this package
2. open the file localContext.js found in the same directory as this file.
   Change the value of the variable 'local' so that it equals true. Save and 
   close the file.
3. Open the server directory (root/server) open terminal and run 'npm i' wait 
   for the process to complete then run 'npm start'.Wait for a response saying 
   the server is listening, minimize terminal.
4. Proceeded to the app directory root/app open a new terminal and run the
   following command 'npm i' wait till that process finishes and run
   'npm run dev' wait.
5. You should get a response from the terminal command in step 4. with a 
   clickable colorized link that will say something like the following:
   'http://localhost:5173/'
   While holding 'Ctrl' click the link to open the app.
