At this time this is a simple weather and new headline app, I hope to add more 
functionality in the future. You can clone this package and follow the steps 
below to use the app.

Steps to Clone and Open

1. clone this package
2. Open the server directory (root/server) open terminal and run 'npm i' wait 
   for the process to complete then run 'npm start'. Wait for a response saying 
   the server is listening, minimize terminal.
3. Proceeded to the app directory root/app open a new terminal and run the
   following command 'npm i' wait till that process finishes and run
   'npm run dev' wait.
4. You should get a response from the terminal command (in step 4) with a 
   clickable and colorized link that will say something like the following:
   'http://localhost:5173/'
   While holding 'Ctrl' click that link to open the app.
